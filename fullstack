3.	Design and implement an Express.js application to manage a list of books. Each book must have an id, title, and author. Initialize the application with at least two predefined books stored in an in-memory array. The application must support the following functionalities:

a.	The GET /books route should return the list of all books.
b.	The POST /books route should accept a new book's title and author in the request body, assign it a unique id, add it to the array, and return a confirmation message.
c.	The PUT /books/:id route should update an existing book’s title and/or author based on the id provided in the URL. Only the fields present in the request body should be updated. If the book is not found, return a 404 status with an appropriate message.
d.	The DELETE /books/:id route should remove a book by its id. If the book does not exist, return a 404 error. Otherwise, return a success message indicating which book was deleted.
e.	Ensure proper use of express.json() middleware and return all responses in plain text format using res.send().





4.	Develop an Express.js application that provides basic functionality for managing student records. Each student should have an id, name, and course. Initialize the application with at least three student records in an in-memory array. The application must implement the following:
a.	The route GET /students should return a list of all students.
b.	The route GET /students/:id should return details of a single student based on the ID provided in the URL.
c.	The route POST /students should accept a new student's name and course via the request body, assign a unique ID, add the student to the array, and return a message confirming the addition.
d.	The route PUT /students/:id should update the student’s name and/or course for the given ID. If the student does not exist, the server should return a 404 error.
e.	The route DELETE /students/:id should remove a student from the list and return the details of the deleted student.
f.	Use express.json() middleware to parse JSON input, and use res.send() for all output. Ensure appropriate status codes and messages are used for both success and error responses.
